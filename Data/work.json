    "description": "Tridal is a multiplayer, cooperative environment that advocates responsible land use. The game is built with socket.io and vanilla javascript using the FAO's statistical database across categories like 'Forestry Production and Trade’, and ‘Temperature change on land’. Tridal reprioritises current resources– forests, farms, urban land, etc. – using mechanics that shift thinking paradigms. Every in-game action has multitudinous consequences, illustrating the scale of human damage. This project was supported by Rhizome Microgrants 2023.",

Suffice it to say, I was thinking about home a lot. Specifically, I was thinking about how most of us live across many homes, tiny bits of our souls traced back to each place. I wanted to converse about the many homes we've inhabited and the stories we carry. This game also, more crucially, reflected the wayfinding once you've outgrown a home. It embodied my decision-making and my steps to a new home.",
